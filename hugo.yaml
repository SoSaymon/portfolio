  # About

    title: "About Me"
    # image: "/images/me.jpg"
    content: |-
      I'm an AI & Applied Data Science student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, passionate about building machine learning models that solve problems across different domains. While I currently work on LLM projects as a student assistant at BUAS, I'm most interested in general purpose ML algorithms like classification, regression, and prediction models that can be applied anywhere.
    
      I enjoy the versatility of core machine learning techniques that aren't tied to a specific domain. Whether it's training models to classify images, predict time series data, or detect patterns in any type of dataset, I'm drawn to projects where I can experiment with different algorithms and see what works best. I'm particularly interested in exploring computer vision and robotics as new application areas for these techniques.
    
      When I'm not coding or training models, you'll find me at the gym, tinkering with hardware projects, or exploring new datasets to experiment with. I believe the best way to understand ML is by applying algorithms to diverse problems and learning from the results.
